Charmhub migration for stable/train (bionic-only)

This is the main patch for the migration of the stable/21.10
charm to charmhub for the stable/train branch (train track on
charmhub).  This patch initially supports bionic from queens
to train, and does not support ussuri.  It supports upgrades
from bionic-queens to bionic-train (with each intermediate
step needed).  Crucially it does NOT set a default
openstack-origin, which means installing train/stable
without specifying the openstack-origin will result in a
bionic-queens installation.  This is intentional as the branch
covers queens to train.
