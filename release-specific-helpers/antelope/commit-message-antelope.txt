Stable artefacts for stable/2023.1 (antelope)

This patch is to lock the stable/2023.1 (antelope release) charms
down so that as much as possible.
In particular, this patch does:

- set the .gitreview to stable/2023.1
- lock zaza and zaza-openstack-tests to stable/antelope branches
- for reactive charms Add build.lock files to lock the layers
  and python modules used to build the charm.
- for ops framework charms, extract a pip freeze from the
  charmcraft container after building the charm to lock the
  modules used to build the charm.
- drop the kinetic bundles if the exist. (Note the updates to
  tests.yaml is in another batch (topic: antelope-voting)
- update the bundles so that they point to the antelope specific
  channels.  e.g. 2023.1/edge for OpenStack charms, 23.03/edge for
  OVN charms, quincy/edge for Ceph charms and generally, the
  appropriate LTS Jammy branch for the various support charms.
